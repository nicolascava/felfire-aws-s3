> AWS S3 plugin for Felfire

> ‚ùå Sorry, but this library is no longer maintained. Please find an alternative.

## Getting started

Felfire AWS S3 is part of the [Felfire](https://github.com/nicolascava/felfire) plugin ecosystem.

## Why Felfire AWS S3?

Felfire AWS S3 is a plugin that takes compiled sources from a Felfire app or website then deploy it to a specified AWS S3's bucket.
 
Its purpose is to improve the developer experience on deployment pipelines.

## Command

Felfire AWS S3 will take sources from the build directory (e.q. `buildDir` from Felfire's configuration) to do its deployment process:

```bash
felfire aws-s3 [--env=staging]
```

### Option

`--env`: specify on which environment you want to deploy your sources (default to `production`). The second choice is `staging`. If specified, Felfire AWS S3 will prefix your bucket's name with `staging.` (removing `www.` prefix if present).

## Custom configuration

Here are the full options explained:

```json
"plugins": [
  ["aws-s3", {
    "bucket": "my-bucket-name",
    "region": "us-west-2"
  }]
]
```
